    question: "What is a remote assistant?",
    answer: "Helm's remote assistants are hungry, humble and highly intelligent professionals and support you and your team as truly as they live on. They work in your time zone and integrate with your team as deeply as you would like. Many of our client partners, within four months of hiring, say their remote assistant is as much a part of the team as the other people in their company.",
    defaultOpen: true
  },
  {
    question: "What are the challenges and benefits of a remote assistant?",
    answer: "The main challenge is building trust and communication with someone who works remotely. However, the benefits far outweigh this: significant cost savings, access to a global talent pool, increased flexibility, and the ability to scale your team without the overhead of office space. Our assistants are trained to integrate seamlessly with your workflow."
  },
  {
    question: "How is Helm unique?",
    answer: "Helm stands out through our rigorous vetting process, ongoing support, and our focus on creating long-term matches. We don't just find someone with the right skills - we find someone who fits your working style, understands your industry, and is committed to growing with your business. Our success rate speaks for itself."
  },
  {
    question: "How does onboarding work?",
    answer: "Our onboarding process is designed to be smooth and efficient. First, we create a Success Profile based on your needs. Then, we screen candidates and present you with the top matches. Once you select your assistant, we facilitate the introduction and provide ongoing support during the first 90 days to ensure success."
  },
  {
    question: "How long will it take to find the right remote assistant with Helm?",
    answer: "Our team screens over 3,000 candidates on average to find you the perfect match. Typically, the process takes 2-3 weeks from initial consultation to presenting candidates. Over 80% of the time, the first candidate we propose gets hired, which speaks to the quality of our matching process."

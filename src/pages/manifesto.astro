        <!-- Introduction -->
        <div class="mb-8 sm:mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3 sm:mb-4">Do you want to love your experience with work?</h2>
          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Are you a business owner seeking A-player support? Or a talented professional looking for the right opportunity? If so, we're here to help you unlock your potential.

          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            While we've called ourselves a staffing firm, business owners and talented professionals call us "growth partners." Here's why.

        <!-- For Talented Professionals -->
        <div class="mb-8 sm:mb-12">
          <h2 class="text-xl sm:text-2xl lg:text-3xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-3 sm:mb-4">If you're a talented professional…</h2>
          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            We help you discover your dream job. Imagine each morning, you wake up with a sense of peace and joy that feels hard to describe. You go to work in a role you love so much, you get lost in your work, so focused that hours pass unnoticed. By the end of the day, you feel recharged, with more energy than you had at the start. You clearly understand your purpose and your place in the grand scheme of things. Your work supports this purpose, bringing you deep contentment and calm.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            Obstacles, both big and small, appear along your journey, but you see them as opportunities to grow stronger. They challenge you, like a sharpener to a blade, helping you become your best self. You keep moving forward with determination, trusting in what you want to achieve without being attached to the outcome. There are moments when it feels like you're riding a powerful wave, as if the universe itself is working alongside you. Doors that seemed closed suddenly open, and amazing coincidences seem to guide your way. You achieve extraordinary things, things you never thought possible. But even if you hadn't, you'd be just fine. You accept praise with grace, yet stay true to your own path, following the rhythm that's uniquely yours.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-4">
            This is the vision we have for you as a talented professional. To make this a reality, we actively coach you throughout your journey. We elicit guidance from your manager. We provide structure with KPIs or big quarterly goals that get you and your manager on the same page, bringing clarity and predictability to both of you. We help you and your boss navigate difficult conversations, ensuring that each of you attacks problems instead of (as occasionally some people are inclined to) attacking each other.
          </p>
          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            We help you chart your career path a year into the future, and potentially many years into the future. You grow over time, and your income grows. We coach you, helping you set worthy personal goals, address big challenges, access helpful learning, and remove obstacles along the way.

        <!-- Core Principles -->
        <div class="mb-8 sm:mb-12">
          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            We know that the right person in the right role can be immeasurably rewarding to everyone involved. We also know that we are the right partner only if you align with our principles: entrepreneurship, attentiveness, curiosity, and a hunger for growth.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 sm:mb-3">Entrepreneurship</h3>
          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Entrepreneurship means always striving to create value and finding opportunities even in challenges. It's about resourcefulness and a mental model that sees the possibilities within problems, leading to a more rewarding, joyful work experience.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 sm:mb-3">Attentiveness</h3>
          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Attentiveness starts with paying attention to the details, building trust, and creating a warm, supportive environment. It's about showing up, being present, and ensuring that things are done with care and consideration for others.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 sm:mb-3">Curiosity</h3>
          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed mb-6">
            Curiosity drives innovation. Asking "what if?" to improve processes, solve problems, and find better ways to do things helps us move forward, together, as a company.
          </p>

          <h3 class="text-lg sm:text-xl lg:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-2 sm:mb-3">Hunger for growth</h3>
          <p class="text-base sm:text-lg lg:text-xl text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            A hunger for growth means we strive for continuous development—individually, as teams, and as a company. Whether through personal learning or by encouraging others, growth is at the heart of everything we do.
